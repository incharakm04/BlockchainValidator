# ðŸ§± Blockchain Simulator

A simple web-based blockchain simulator built with Flask (Python) and Bootstrap. This project demonstrates the core concepts of blockchain, including block creation, tampering, and validation, with an interactive UI.

## Features

- **Add Block:** Add new blocks with custom data to the blockchain.
- **Tamper Block:** Modify the data of any block to simulate tampering.
- **Validate Blockchain:** Check if the blockchain is valid or has been tampered with.
- **Visual Feedback:** Tampered blocks are highlighted for easy identification.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean and modern interface using Bootstrap.

## Project Structure

```
/blockchain_simulator
    /templates
     /index.html
    app.py
    README.md
```

- **/templates:** Contains HTML templates for rendering the web pages.
- **app.py:** The main Flask application file.
- **README.md:** This documentation file.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask:** A micro web framework for Python.
- **Bootstrap:** A front-end framework for developing responsive websites.
- **JavaScript:** A programming language for web development.
- **HTML/CSS:** Markup and style sheet languages for creating web pages.
